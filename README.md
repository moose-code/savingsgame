# Welcome to the game of savings

Game of savings is a simple smart contract that helps users learn some of the most important concepts of developing in Solidity, to deploy awesome and safe smart contracts.

The rules of the game are as follows:

You decide that you and you friends need to learn how to save money better. You are always spending it buying beers instead of saving for the future.
You say to your friends, lets all deposit R100 every month to save for the year. At the end of the year, we will split all the money deposited equally,
with everyone who diligently saved every month.

i.e. those friends who only managed to save a couple months of the year would lose out!

If every one saves the whole year, well then we all learnt a valuable lesson and everyone gets their savings back!

How could this be implemented? Without blockchain, you and all your friends would have to trust each other, pass banking details etc.. and it could be
quite messy.
cd
Implementing this on ethereum means that code is law and your system will behave exactly as intended without anyone being able to influence the outcome.

We are going to implement a simple version of the above game.

Can you think of how to implement this game so that it is safe?
